        <p>Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me; with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the sun's rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some enchanter's wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.</p>

        <p>"Clear away the boats! Luff!" cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.</p>

        <p>The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.</p>

        <p>"There go flukes!" was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by Stubb's producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker's boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honour of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play. And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault.</p>

        <p>Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy, he was going "head out"; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed.*</p>

        <p>*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists. Though apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.</p>

        <p>"Start her, start her, my men! Don't hurry yourselves; take plenty of time&mdash;but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that's all," cried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. "Start her, now; give 'em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy&mdash;start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool&mdash;cucumbers is the word&mdash;easy, easy&mdash;only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys&mdash;that's all. Start her!"</p>

        <p>"Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave.</p>

        <p>But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. "Kee-hee! Kee-hee!" yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.</p>

        <p>"What was them stone houses for?" Hare-Lip queried.</p>

        <p>"You remember when your dad taught you to swim?" The boy nodded.  "Well, in the University of California&mdash;that is the name we had for  the houses&mdash;we taught young men and women how to think, just as I have  taught you now, by sand and pebbles and shells, to know how many people  lived in those days. There was very much to teach. The young men and  women we taught were called students. We had large rooms in which we  taught. I talked to them, forty or fifty at a time, just as I am talking  to you now. I told them about the books other men had written before  their time, and even, sometimes, in their time&mdash;"</p>

        <p>"Was that all you did?&mdash;just talk, talk, talk?" Hoo-Hoo demanded. "Who  hunted your meat for you? and milked the goats? and caught the fish?"</p>

        <p>"A sensible question, Hoo-Hoo, a sensible question. As I have told you,  in those days food-getting was easy. We were very wise. A few men got  the food for many men. The other men did other things. As you say, I  talked. I talked all the time, and for this food was given me&mdash;much  food, fine food, beautiful food, food that I have not tasted in sixty  years and shall never taste again. I sometimes think the most wonderful  achievement of our tremendous civilization was food&mdash;its inconceivable  abundance, its infinite variety, its marvellous delicacy. O my  grandsons, life was life in those days, when we had such wonderful  things to eat."</p>

        <p>This was beyond the boys, and they let it slip by, words and thoughts,  as a mere senile wandering in the narrative.</p>

        <p>"Our food-getters were called freemen. This was a joke. We of the  ruling classes owned all the land, all the machines, everything. These  food-getters were our slaves. We took almost all the food they got, and  left them a little so that they might eat, and work, and get us more  food&mdash;"</p>

        <p>"I'd have gone into the forest and got food for myself," Hare-Lip  announced; "and if any man tried to take it away from me, I'd have  killed him."</p>

        <p>The old man laughed.</p>

        <p>"Did I not tell you that we of the ruling class owned all the land, all  the forest, everything? Any food-getter who would not get food for us,  him we punished or compelled to starve to death. And very few did that.  They preferred to get food for us, and make clothes for us, and prepare  and administer to us a thousand&mdash;a mussel-shell, Hoo-Hoo&mdash;a thousand  satisfactions and delights. And I was Professor Smith in those  days&mdash;Professor James Howard Smith. And my lecture courses were very  popular&mdash;that is, very many of the young men and women liked to hear me  talk about the books other men had written.</p>
